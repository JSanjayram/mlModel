## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Comparison

### Why We Use Multiple Models
We implement three different machine learning algorithms to ensure robust predictions and compare their effectiveness:

### 1. Random Forest
- **Purpose**: Ensemble learning for stable predictions
- **Strengths**: Handles non-linear relationships, reduces overfitting
- **Use Case**: Baseline model for profit prediction
- **Performance**: Good interpretability with feature importance

### 2. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Purpose**: Advanced gradient boosting for high accuracy
- **Strengths**: Excellent performance on structured data, handles missing values
- **Use Case**: High-accuracy profit forecasting
- **Performance**: Often achieves best R¬≤ scores

### 3. LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)
- **Purpose**: Fast and efficient gradient boosting
- **Strengths**: Faster training, lower memory usage, good accuracy
- **Use Case**: Quick model training and deployment
- **Performance**: Balance between speed and accuracy

### Model Selection Process
1. **Training**: All models trained on same dataset
2. **Evaluation**: Compared using R¬≤ score, MAE, and RMSE
3. **Validation**: Cross-validation to ensure generalization
4. **Selection**: Best performing model used for predictions
