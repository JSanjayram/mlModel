ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Comparison
Why Multiple Models?

Using multiple models ensures robust predictions by comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms. Here's a breakdown of each model:

1. Random Forest

Purpose: Ensemble learning for stable predictions.

Strengths: Handles non-linear relationships and reduces overfitting.

Use Case: Baseline model for profit prediction.

Performance: Good interpretability with feature importance.

2. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

Purpose: Advanced gradient boosting for high accuracy.

Strengths: Excellent performance on structured data, handles missing values.

Use Case: High-accuracy profit forecasting.

Performance: Often achieves the best R¬≤ scores.

3. LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

Purpose: Fast and efficient gradient boosting.

Strengths: Faster training, lower memory usage, good accuracy.

Use Case: Quick model training and deployment.

Performance: A balance between speed and accuracy.

Model Selection Process

Training: All models are trained on the same dataset.

Evaluation: Models are compared using R¬≤ score, MAE, and RMSE.

Validation: Cross-validation ensures generalization.

Selection: The best-performing model is used for predictions.
